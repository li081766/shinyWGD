Description: Provides a comprehensive Shiny application for analyzing 
    Whole Genome Duplication ('WGD') events.
    This package provides a user-friendly Shiny web application for 
    non-experienced researchers to prepare input data and execute command lines 
    for several well-known 'WGD' analysis tools, including 'wgd', 'ksrates', 
    'i-ADHoRe', 'OrthoFinder', and 'Whale'. This package also provides the source code 
    for experienced researchers to adjust and install the package to their own server. 
    Key Features
    1) Input Data Preparation 
    This package allows users to conveniently upload and format their data, 
	making it compatible with various 'WGD' analysis tools.
    2) Command Line Generation
    This package automatically generates the necessary command lines for 
	selected 'WGD' analysis tools, reducing manual errors and saving time.
    3) Visualization
    This package offers interactive visualizations to explore and interpret 'WGD' results, 
	facilitating in-depth 'WGD' analysis.
    4) Comparative Genomics
    Users can study and compare 'WGD' events across different species, 
	aiding in evolutionary and comparative genomics studies.
    5) User-Friendly Interface 
	This Shiny web application provides an intuitive and accessible interface, 
	making 'WGD' analysis accessible to researchers and 'bioinformaticians' of all levels.
