\usage{
obtain_chromosome_length_filter(species_info_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_info_df}{A data frame containing species information with columns "sp," "cds," and "gff."}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames: len_df for chromosome lengths and num_df for mRNA counts.
}
\description{
Process a data frame containing species information and extract chromosome lengths and mRNA counts from GFF files.
}
\examples{
Create a sample data frame
species_info_df <- data.frame(
  sp=c("SpeciesA", "SpeciesB"),
  cds=c("cds_file_A.gff", "cds_file_B.gff"),
  gff=c("gff_file_A.gff", "gff_file_B.gff")
)

# Obtain chromosome lengths and mRNA counts
result <- obtain_chromosome_length_filter(species_info_df)
}
