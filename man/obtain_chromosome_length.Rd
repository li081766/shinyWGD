\usage{
obtain_chromosome_length(species_info_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_info_file}{A character string specifying the path to the species information file.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames: len_df for chromosome lengths and num_df for mRNA counts.
}
\description{
Process species information file and extract chromosome lengths and mRNA counts from GFF files.
}
\examples{
# Load the species information into a data frame (replace 'species_info_df' with your actual data frame)
species_info_df <- read.table("path/to/your/species_info_file.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Call the obtain_chromosome_length_filter function
result <- obtain_chromosome_length_filter(species_info_df)

# Access the chromosome length and mRNA count data frames from the result
len_df <- result$len_df
num_df <- result$num_df

# Print the first few rows of the data frames
head(len_df)
head(num_df)
}
